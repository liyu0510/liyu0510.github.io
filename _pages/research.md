## Working Paper
**Monetary Policy and Global Bank Lending: A Reversal Interest Rate Approach**

Joint with [Philipp Wangner](https://www.pwangner.com/home). *Job Market Paper*.

This paper studies the impact of monetary policy on the credit allocation of globally operating banks. We document variations in the composition of bank lending in terms of domestic and foreign assets for over thirty countries. At the country level, the bias toward domestic lending continuously fell in the early 2000s but increased by 10\% during the low interest rate period after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). To account for this finding, we develop an analytical framework for global banking based on a portfolio approach, in which the credit allocation is jointly determined by three key elements: diversification opportunities, cross-border frictions, and bank profitability driven by interest margins between lending and deposit rates. The effect of expansionary monetary policy on bank home bias is \textit{state-dependent}. In times of low bank profitability and large balance sheet size, a further cut in the interest rate raises bank home bias, which rationalizes the surge in home bias observed after the GFC. Extended to a dynamic setup, the model shows that the prolonged period of low interest rates is accompanied by a persistently high bias towards the domestic asset. Finally, we embed the bank problem in a model with private sectors and nominal rigidities and quantify the reduction in monetary policy effectiveness in terms of stimulating credit supply due to banks' portfolio rebalancing across the border.

**Uncertainty Shock(s)**

Joint with [Hussein Bidawi](https://sites.google.com/site/husseinbidawi/). Draft available upon request.

This paper provides evidence that the current identification of uncertainty shock using structural autoregression (SVAR) models is polluted by different shocks and proposes distinguishing between uncertainty about the future and first-order shock to sentiment. We first establish that uncertainty shock identified in SVAR models is composed of multiple shocks by showing that the same identification scheme of uncertainty shock generates vastly different responses of real economy variables if we switch between different uncertainty proxies. Next, we separately identify an aggregate uncertainty shock from stock and gold prices and volatilities and quantify the different effects on consumer sentiment. Using firm-level sentiment measures from textual analysis, we further provide evidence for the link between firm-level uncertainty and sentiment. Lastly, we rationalize how sentiment and uncertainty interact through information acquisition under rational inattention using a theoretical framework.


**Shadow Banks vs. Commercial Banks: Different Responses or Different Shocks?**

 Draft available upon request.

This paper provides new empirical evidence on the heterogeneity inside the financial intermediary sector, namely the collection of commercial banks and shadow banks. We run two sets of experiments to explore the reaction of different banking sectors to different shocks, using a structural VAR model. In the first experiments, we adopt both short-run and proxy identification methods to check how they react to monetary policy shocks and discover that the same contractionary monetary shock triggers different responses in commercial banks and government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). In the second experiment, we use the max share identification method to respectively determine the shocks that affect banks and shadow banks the most. We find that the shocks are potentially different across commercial banks and GSEs, but commercial banks and private shadow banks might be highly connected. These results confirm that understanding the heterogeneity and interconnectedness of the financial intermediary sector is essential for ensuring both policy effectiveness and economic stability. Therefore, sector-specific supervision and regulations of the banking system could be potentially helpful in terms of monitoring how shocks may propagate through and be amplified by the financial system.
